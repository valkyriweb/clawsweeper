# 🦞🧹 ClawSweeper

ClawSweeper is the conservative maintenance bot for OpenClaw repositories. It
keeps the backlog reviewed, keeps maintainer-visible GitHub comments tidy, and
turns narrow trusted findings into guarded repair or automerge work.

The current production targets are `openclaw/openclaw`, `openclaw/clawhub`, and
self-review for `openclaw/clawsweeper`.

The OpenClaw-hosted ClawSweeper instance is not a public review service and does
not provide free reviews for third-party repositories. If you want ClawSweeper
for your own project, fork this repository, deploy it in your own organization,
and configure that self-hosted instance for your repositories.

At a high level ClawSweeper:

- reviews open issues and pull requests on a schedule and on exact GitHub events
- writes one durable markdown report per item in generated state
- syncs one marker-backed public review comment per issue or PR, edited in place
- closes only unchanged, high-confidence, policy-allowed proposals
- routes maintainer commands such as `@clawsweeper review`,
  `@clawsweeper fix`, `@clawsweeper autofix`, and `@clawsweeper automerge`
- can acknowledge maintainer comment commands through an optional GitHub App
  webhook before the GitHub Actions fallback starts
- repairs opted-in PRs through a bounded Codex review/fix loop before merge
- can open guarded implementation PRs for strict, reproducible bug issues
- reviews code-bearing commits that land on target `main` branches
- publishes dashboard, audit, repair, and activity state to
  `valkyriweb/clawsweeper-state`

ClawSweeper is not a generic auto-close bot. Review is proposal-only, apply is
guarded, Codex never gets write credentials during review, and every GitHub
mutation is rechecked against live target state immediately before it happens.

## Capabilities

### Issue and PR Reviews

Scheduled runs scan open issues and pull requests, while target repositories can
forward exact issue/PR events with `repository_dispatch` for low-latency
one-item reviews. Each review writes
`records/<repo-slug>/items/<number>.md` with the decision, evidence, proposed
maintainer-facing comment, runtime metadata, and GitHub snapshot hash.

ClawSweeper syncs one marker-backed public review comment per item and edits it
in place instead of posting repeated comments. If a review starts before a
completed comment exists, it first posts a short status placeholder, then
replaces that same comment with the final review. Pull request comments include
hidden verdict/action markers so trusted repair and automerge flows can continue
without scraping visible prose. See
[`docs/pr-review-comments.md`](docs/pr-review-comments.md).

For open issues with complete, current kept-open reviews, ClawSweeper also
projects selected structured review conclusions into advisory GitHub labels for
maintainer filtering and project views. These labels expose states such as
current-main reproduction, source reproduction, linked open PRs, queueable
fixes, missing info, and product/security review needs. They are advisory only
and do not trigger repair, merge, or close behavior. Label-only syncs record
`labels_synced_at` in the durable report so GitHub `updated_at` changes caused
by ClawSweeper-owned label writes do not look like fresh target-side activity to
the scheduler. See
[`docs/work-lane.md`](docs/work-lane.md).

### Apply and State

Apply mode re-fetches live GitHub state, checks labels, maintainer authorship,
paired issue/PR state, snapshot drift, and repository profile rules before
commenting or closing anything. Closed or already-closed reports move to
`records/<repo-slug>/closed/<number>.md`; reopened archived items move back to
`items/` as stale work.

Generated state lives on the `state` branch of `valkyriweb/clawsweeper-state`:
durable `records/`, `jobs/`, `results/`, audit output, workflow status JSON,
repair ledgers, and the rendered dashboard. The state repo `main` branch is the
dashboard renderer source, so a checkout on `main` intentionally does not show
`records/`. Hydrate this repo with `git -C ../clawsweeper-state switch state &&
node scripts/hydrate-state.ts --state-dir ../clawsweeper-state` when local
commands need generated records. This repository stays focused on source,
workflows, docs, and tests.

### Repair and Automerge

Maintainer commands can opt PRs into `autofix` or `automerge`, dispatch a fresh
exact-head review, and run a bounded Codex review/fix loop. Codex handles the
code repair and local validation loop; deterministic executor steps own every
GitHub mutation, branch push, label update, and final merge gate.

Automerge waits for exact-head review, required checks, mergeability, and policy
gates. If repair was needed, the mutable status comment records each review,
repair, re-review, and merge step with timing and links. The final merge result
summarizes both the original PR change and any ClawSweeper fixups.

For issues, strict bug reviews that are high-confidence reproducible, do not
already have a linked PR, and do not require feature/config expansion can
dispatch Codex to open one guarded implementation PR labeled
`clawsweeper:autogenerated`.

### Commit Reviews

Push events on target `main` branches can dispatch to
`.github/workflows/commit-review.yml`. The workflow expands the commit range,
skips non-code-only commits cheaply, starts one Codex worker per code-bearing
commit, and writes `records/<repo-slug>/commits/<sha>.md`.

Commit reports are the source of truth. Optional target commit Check Runs are
disabled by default and can be enabled per run or repository. Reports with
`result: findings` can dispatch to repair intake when the finding is narrow,
non-security, and still relevant on latest `main`.

### Operations

Repository-specific rules live in `src/repository-profiles.ts`, so OpenClaw,
ClawHub, and ClawSweeper can share the same engine while keeping different apply
limits. Both review and repair lanes support manual workflow dispatch, reruns,
and backfills. `pnpm commit-reports -- --since 24h`, `--findings`,
`--non-clean`, `--repo`, and `--author` query flat per-SHA commit storage
without date buckets.

## Guardrails

ClawSweeper may propose a close only when the item is clearly one of these:

- implemented on current `main`
- not reproducible on current `main`
- better suited for ClawHub skill/plugin work than core
- duplicate or superseded by a canonical issue/PR
- concrete but not actionable in this source repo
- incoherent enough that no action can be taken
- stale issue older than 60 days with too little data to verify

Maintainer-authored items are never auto-closed. Everything else stays open.
Issues with an open PR that references them using GitHub closing syntax such as
`Fixes #123` stay open until that PR merges or is closed.
Open issue/PR pairs from the same author stay open together unless the paired
item is already resolved or a maintainer explicitly asks to close one side.

Repository profiles can further narrow apply. ClawHub and ClawSweeper self-review
are intentionally stricter: they review issues and PRs, but apply may close only
PRs where current `main` already implements the proposed change with
source-backed evidence.

## Maintainer Commands

Maintainers can steer ClawSweeper from target-repo issue and PR comments. The
preferred form is `@clawsweeper ...`. The router also accepts
`@clawsweeper[bot] ...`, `@openclaw-clawsweeper ...`,
`@openclaw-clawsweeper[bot] ...`, and legacy slash aliases such as
`/clawsweeper ...`, `/review`, `/automerge`, `/auto merge`, and
`/autoclose <reason>`.

Common commands:

```text
@clawsweeper status
@clawsweeper re-review
@clawsweeper re-run
@clawsweeper review
@clawsweeper fix ci
@clawsweeper address review
@clawsweeper rebase
@clawsweeper autofix
@clawsweeper automerge
@clawsweeper approve
@clawsweeper explain
@clawsweeper stop
@clawsweeper why did automerge stop here?
```

- `status` and `explain` post a short target summary.
- `review`, `re-review`, and `re-run` dispatch a fresh ClawSweeper issue/PR
  review without starting repair.
- Command status replies are marker-backed and edited in place per
  issue/PR, intent, and head SHA. The visible badge is one lobster plus the
  current state: `👀` for acknowledgement, `🧹` for review, `🔧` for repair, and
  `✅` for completed/paused work.
- Freeform `@clawsweeper ...` mentions dispatch a read-only assist review that
  answers the maintainer request in the next ClawSweeper comment. Action-looking
  prose still maps through existing safe markers and deterministic gates.
- `fix ci`, `address review`, and `rebase` dispatch the repair worker only for
  ClawSweeper PRs or PRs already opted into `clawsweeper:autofix` or
  `clawsweeper:automerge`.
- `autofix` labels an open PR, creates or reuses the adopted job, dispatches
  review, and enters the bounded review/fix loop without merging.
- `automerge` labels an open PR, creates or reuses the adopted job, dispatches
  review, and enters the bounded review/fix/merge loop. Draft PRs are fix-only
  until GitHub marks them ready for review.
- User-facing OpenClaw `fix`, `feat`, and `perf` automerge PRs get a
  maintainer/ClawSweeper-owned `CHANGELOG.md` entry before merge; contributors
  are not asked to add it.
- Security-sensitive findings can be repaired only after explicit
  `autofix`/`automerge` opt-in; ClawSweeper still will not merge until a later
  exact-head review is clean.
- `approve` lets a maintainer clear a ClawSweeper human-review pause and merge
  only after the normal exact-head, checks, mergeability, and gate checks pass.
- `stop` removes repair-loop labels, adds `clawsweeper:human-review`, and makes
  older automerge/autofix comments ineligible to continue. `/autoclose <reason>`
  closes the item and any open same-repo targets explicitly referenced in the
  command text.

Only maintainers are accepted for write actions. The router checks repository
collaborator permission (`admin`, `maintain`, or `write`) and falls back to
trusted `author_association` values when permission lookup is unavailable.
Users with repository write access and issue/PR authors may ask
`@clawsweeper re-review` or `@clawsweeper re-run` for a fresh read-only review.
Other contributor commands are ignored without a reply. Scheduled comment routing is dry unless
`CLAWSWEEPER_COMMENT_ROUTER_EXECUTE=1`; workflow dispatch with `execute=true`
can be used for one-off live routing.

## Dashboard

Live dashboard and generated state: https://github.com/valkyriweb/clawsweeper-state

Live pipeline dashboard: https://clawsweeper.openclaw.ai/

The Cloudflare dashboard is observability-only: it shows active workers,
repair/automerge pipeline rows, CI state, recent failures, and automerge timing
without owning GitHub mutations. See [`docs/live-dashboard.md`](docs/live-dashboard.md).
Model usage telemetry writes sanitized `usage-events.jsonl` artifacts and can
broadcast OTLP spans for SigNoz/Opik fan-out, including cache health and
per-session timelines. See [`docs/telemetry.md`](docs/telemetry.md).

The optional triage dashboard page at `/triage` exposes ClawSweeper advisory
issue labels as read-only maintainer views, backed by GitHub Search snapshots
instead of GitHub Project writes. See
[`docs/triage-dashboard.md`](docs/triage-dashboard.md).

The optional PR proof triage page at `/pr-proof-triage` exposes open pull
requests that are blocked on real behavior proof labels, including missing
proof, supplied-but-not-sufficient proof, mock-only proof, and proof label
mismatches. See
[`docs/pr-proof-triage-dashboard.md`](docs/pr-proof-triage-dashboard.md).

## How It Works

ClawSweeper is split into four operational lanes:

- review lane: scheduled and event-driven issue/PR reviews, durable reports, and
  public review comment sync
- apply lane: guarded close/comment mutations, audit, reconcile, and state
  publishing
- repair lane: maintainer-command routing, autofix, automerge, issue
  implementation PRs, and repair result publishing
- commit review lane: main-branch commit dispatch, cheap code/non-code
  classification, one Codex review worker per code-bearing commit, and optional
  target commit checks

### Scheduler

The issue/PR scheduler decides what to scan and how often. New and active items
get more attention; older quiet items fall back to a slower cadence. Detailed
scheduling, capacity, and monitoring behavior is documented in
[`docs/scheduler.md`](docs/scheduler.md).

- hot/new and recently active items are checked hourly, with a 5-minute intake
  schedule for the newest queue edge
- target repositories can forward issue and PR events with
  `repository_dispatch`; those exact item runs use a dedicated single job to
  review one item, sync the durable comment, and apply only safe close
  proposals for that same item
- pull requests and issues younger than 30 days are checked daily once they
  leave the hot window
- older inactive issues are checked weekly
- apply wakes every 15 minutes and exits quickly when there are no unchanged
  high-confidence close proposals

### Review Lane

Review is proposal-only. It never closes items.

- A planner scans open issues and PRs, then assigns exact item numbers to shards.
- Manual runs can pass `item_number` or comma-separated `item_numbers` to review
  exact Audit Health findings without scanning for a normal batch.
- Each shard checks out the selected target repository at `main`.
- Codex reviews with `gpt-5.5`, high reasoning, the default service tier, and a
  10-minute per-item timeout.
- Each item becomes a flat report under
  `records/<repo-slug>/items/<number>.md` with the decision, evidence,
  Codex `/review`-style PR findings, suggested comment, runtime metadata, and
  GitHub snapshot hash. When GitHub exposes a merged closing PR for an issue,
  the report records that PR and the close comment links it as fix provenance.
- High-confidence allowed close decisions become `proposed_close`.
- After publish, the lane checks the selected items' single marker-backed Codex
  review comment. Missing comments and missing metadata are synced immediately;
  existing comments are refreshed only when stale, currently weekly.
- PR review comments keep the top-level note concise, put source links and full
  evidence in collapsed details, and use hidden verdict/action markers for the
  trusted ClawSweeper repair loop; see
  [`docs/pr-review-comments.md`](docs/pr-review-comments.md).

### Apply Lane

Apply reads existing reports and mutates GitHub only when the stored review is
still valid.

- Updates the single marker-backed Codex automated review comment in place.
- Closes only unchanged high-confidence proposals.
- Reuses the review comment when closing; no duplicate close comment.
- Moves closed or already-closed reports to
  `records/<repo-slug>/closed/<number>.md`.
- Moves reopened archived reports back to the repo’s `items/` folder as stale.
- Commits checkpoints and machine-readable status during long runs.

Apply wakes every 15 minutes, no-ops when there are no unchanged
high-confidence close proposals, and narrows scheduled runs to the currently
eligible proposal list so idle runs do not scan unrelated keep-open records.
It defaults to all item kinds, no age floor, a 2-second close delay, and 50
fresh closes per checkpoint. If it reaches the requested limit, it queues
another apply run with the same settings.

Exact event runs skip the bulk planner, shard matrix, artifact upload, and
separate publish job. They still use the same review and apply code paths, but
only for the selected item number and only with immediate-safe reasons enabled
by default: `implemented_on_main` and `duplicate_or_superseded`.
`stale_insufficient_info` issue reports and `mostly_implemented_on_main` PR
reports are never applied to young items; apply requires those reports to be at
least 60 days old unless a manual run explicitly changes the threshold.

The external state dashboard is fleet-scoped. Each configured repository gets
its own record folder, status JSON, audit state, cadence counts, and recent
activity section. The state repo aggregates those repository snapshots so event
runs from one repo do not hide the state of another.

There is still one deterministic apply path for writes. Review can propose and
sync stale public review comments, but closing remains guarded by apply so a
fresh GitHub snapshot, labels, maintainer-authorship, and unchanged item state
are checked immediately before mutation.

### Repair Lane

Repair starts from maintainer intent or trusted ClawSweeper review metadata. The
comment router accepts commands from target repositories, validates maintainer
permissions, updates one mutable command/status comment, and dispatches the
appropriate repair job.

- `autofix` and `automerge` adopt the PR branch and run exact-head review before
  making changes.
- If review or CI finds actionable issues, Codex rebases, addresses PR review
  comments, fixes CI, runs the requested validation, and returns a structured
  repair artifact.
- The deterministic executor applies the artifact, pushes only after validation,
  re-dispatches exact-head review, and waits for required checks.
- `automerge` merges only after review verdict, checks, mergeability, changelog,
  security, maintainer stop/approve state, and repository policy gates pass.
- Issue implementation is narrower: only strict, reproducible bugs with no
  linked PR and no feature/config expansion can open a generated PR.

Repair internals are documented in
[`docs/repair/README.md`](docs/repair/README.md), and the automerge state
machine is documented in
[`docs/repair/automerge-flow.md`](docs/repair/automerge-flow.md).

### Commit Review Lane

Commit review is intentionally separate from issue/PR cleanup. It never closes
items, writes comments, or fixes code.

- Target repositories forward `push` events from `main` with
  `repository_dispatch`.
- Manual runs can pass `commit_sha`, optional `before_sha`, optional
  `additional_prompt`, `enabled`, and `create_checks`.
- The receiver verifies the selected commits are reachable from `origin/main`.
- Before selecting and reviewing commits, the receiver waits 60 seconds by
  default (`CLAWSWEEPER_COMMIT_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS=60`) so a push range has
  time to settle across GitHub and the runner.
- The plan job expands ranges, pages large backfills at GitHub's matrix limit,
  and classifies each commit before Codex starts.
- Pure documentation, changelog, README/license, and asset-only commits get a
  skipped report without spending Codex time.
- Mixed commits and code-bearing commits start one Codex worker per commit. The
  worker checks out current target `main` and reviews the selected commit by
  SHA/range instead of detaching the whole repository at that commit.
- Codex is prompted to read beyond the diff: changed files, callers/callees,
  runtime entry points, adjacent tests/docs, dependency manifests, release
  notes, advisories, web sources, and focused live tests when useful.
- Each commit writes exactly one report at
  `records/<repo-slug>/commits/<40-char-sha>.md`.
- Reruns overwrite the same report, including reruns with an
  `additional_prompt`.
- Report results are `nothing_found`, `findings`, `inconclusive`, `failed`, or
  `skipped_non_code`.
- Optional GitHub Checks use the `ClawSweeper Commit Review` name on the target
  commit. Clean or skipped reports are green; high-confidence high/critical
  findings fail; lower-severity, inconclusive, and failed reviews are neutral.
- Finding reports are dispatched to the repair intake when
  `CLAWSWEEPER_COMMIT_FINDINGS_ENABLED` is not `false`. ClawSweeper owns
  the audit log and any repair PR.

Use `pnpm commit-reports -- --since 24h` to review recent reports and add
`--findings`, `--non-clean`, `--repo`, or `--author` to narrow the list. The
storage stays flat so a rerun can overwrite exactly one file for a commit
without rediscovering a date bucket.

### Safety Model

- Maintainer-authored items are excluded from automated closes.
- Protected labels block close proposals.
- Open PRs with GitHub closing references block issue closes until the PR is
  resolved.
- Open same-author issue/PR pairs block one-sided closes.
- Codex runs without GitHub write tokens.
- Issue/PR event jobs create target write and report-push credentials only after
  Codex exits.
- Commit review workers give Codex only a read-scoped target token as `GH_TOKEN`
  so it can inspect mentioned issues, PRs, workflow runs, and commit metadata.
- Commit write/check credentials are created only after Codex exits.
- CI makes the target checkout read-only for reviews.
- Reviews fail if Codex leaves tracked or untracked changes behind.
- Snapshot changes block apply unless the only change is the bot’s own review
  comment.
- Commit Check Runs are optional and disabled by default.

### Audit

`pnpm run audit` compares live GitHub state with generated records without moving
files. It reports missing open records, archived open records, stale records,
duplicates, protected-label proposed closes, and stale review-status records.
Protected proposed closes are reported only for active repo `items/` records
because archived repo `closed/` records are historical and cannot be applied.
Missing open records are classified as eligible, maintainer-authored, protected,
or recently created so strict audit mode can flag actionable drift without
treating expected queue lag or excluded items as failures.
Use `--update-dashboard` to publish the latest audit state under
`results/audit/` in `valkyriweb/clawsweeper-state` without making every normal
status update scan all open GitHub items. The state repo renders reviewable
findings such as missing eligible records, reopened archived records, and stale
reviews from that state. The
workflow refreshes audit state on a separate six-hour schedule, and it can be run
manually with `audit_dashboard=true`. The read-only audit lane covers
`openclaw/openclaw`, `openclaw/clawhub`, and `openclaw/clawsweeper`; it falls
back to public workflow-token reads when the ClawSweeper App token is not
available for a target.

## Local Run

Requires Node 24.

Issue/PR sweeper:

```bash
source ~/.profile
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run plan -- --target-repo openclaw/openclaw --batch-size 5 --shard-count 5 --max-pages 250 --codex-model gpt-5.5 --codex-reasoning-effort high
pnpm run review -- --target-repo openclaw/openclaw --target-dir ../openclaw --batch-size 5 --max-pages 250 --artifact-dir artifacts/reviews --codex-model gpt-5.5 --codex-reasoning-effort high --codex-timeout-ms 600000
pnpm run apply-artifacts -- --target-repo openclaw/openclaw --artifact-dir artifacts/reviews --skip-dashboard
pnpm run audit -- --target-repo openclaw/openclaw --max-pages 250 --sample-limit 25 --update-dashboard
pnpm run reconcile -- --target-repo openclaw/openclaw --dry-run
```

Apply unchanged proposals later:

```bash
source ~/.profile
corepack enable
pnpm run apply-decisions -- --target-repo openclaw/openclaw --limit 20 --apply-kind all --skip-dashboard
```

Sync durable review comments without closing:

```bash
source ~/.profile
corepack enable
pnpm run apply-decisions -- --target-repo openclaw/openclaw --sync-comments-only --comment-sync-min-age-days 7 --processed-limit 1000 --limit 0 --skip-dashboard
```

List commit reports:

```bash
source ~/.profile
corepack enable
pnpm run build
pnpm commit-reports -- --since 24h
pnpm commit-reports -- --since 24h --findings
pnpm commit-reports -- --repo openclaw/openclaw --author steipete --since 7d
```

Manually rerun commit review through GitHub Actions:

```bash
gh workflow run commit-review.yml \
  --repo openclaw/clawsweeper \
  --ref main \
  -f target_repo=openclaw/openclaw \
  -f commit_sha=<commit-sha> \
  -f before_sha=<parent-or-range-start-sha> \
  -f create_checks=false \
  -f enabled=true \
  -f additional_prompt='Optional extra review focus.'
```

Omit `before_sha` for a single-commit review. Pass `before_sha` to review the
historic range `before_sha..commit_sha`.

Manual review runs are proposal-only. Use `apply_existing=true` to apply unchanged
proposals later. Scheduled apply runs process both issues and pull requests by
default, subject to the selected repository profile; pass `target_repo`,
`apply_kind=issue`, or `apply_kind=pull_request` to narrow a manual run.

Scheduled runs cover the configured product profiles. `openclaw/openclaw` runs
normal backfill every 5 minutes with up to 27 review shards when the system is
quiet; `openclaw/clawhub` runs on offset review/apply/audit crons so its reports
live under `records/openclaw-clawhub/` without colliding with default repo
records. `openclaw/clawsweeper` has a scheduled read-only audit row and is
available for manual and event self-review smoke tests. Broad hot-intake sweeps
cap scheduled fan-out at 19 one-item shards per run when quiet; exact event
reviews still use one shard. Normal review, hot intake, and commit review are
background lanes, so they shrink automatically while repair or exact-item work
is active. Throughput defaults live in
[docs/limits.md](docs/limits.md) and `config/automation-limits.json`.

### Worker Budget

ClawSweeper has one main capacity knob:
`config/automation-limits.json` -> `workers.max`. The current value is `5`.
Lane limits are derived from that number: normal review defaults to 3 shards
for manual/backstop runs, scheduled normal review gets up to 1 after reserves,
hot intake up to 1 shard, commit review 1 commit per page, and
repair/issue implementation 2 live workers. Exact-item review, repair, and
issue implementation are priority work; normal review, hot intake, and commit
review are background work and automatically yield when priority work is active.
Use `workers.max` first when turning total Codex usage up or down; use the
individual environment overrides only for temporary lane-specific exceptions.
For the valkyriweb fork restart procedure, use
[docs/safe-ramp-valkyriweb.md](docs/safe-ramp-valkyriweb.md).

Target repositories can opt into event-level latency by installing the
dispatcher workflow in [docs/target-dispatcher.md](docs/target-dispatcher.md).
The dispatcher sends `repository_dispatch` events to this repository with the
target repo and exact item number; ClawSweeper then runs one event job that
reviews, comments, and checks immediate safe apply instead of waiting for the
next hot-intake cron or bulk publish lane.

Target repositories can opt into main-branch commit review with
[docs/commit-dispatcher.md](docs/commit-dispatcher.md). That dispatcher sends
push ranges to this repository, where ClawSweeper expands the range and writes
one commit report per SHA.

## Checks

```bash
pnpm run check
pnpm run oxformat
```

`oxformat` is an alias for `oxfmt`; there is no separate `oxformat` pnpm package.
The `CI` GitHub Actions workflow uses the latest Node release and runs
`pnpm run check` on pushes, pull requests, and manual dispatches. The check gate
includes the full test suite, a strict changed-surface coverage threshold, and a
full compiled-repo coverage ratchet.

## GitHub Actions Setup

Required secrets:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key used by the per-job local Codex Responses
  proxy. Codex subprocesses inherit only the proxy-backed `CODEX_HOME`, not the
  raw API key.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_APP_CLIENT_ID`: public GitHub App client ID for the deployed
  ClawSweeper GitHub App. Do not copy this from the public app page; use the app
  configured for the deployment (for the live dashboard, see
  `dashboard/wrangler.toml`).
- `CLAWSWEEPER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: private key for the same GitHub App; plan/review
  jobs use a short-lived GitHub App installation token for read-heavy target API
  calls, commit review uses a read-scoped target token while Codex runs, and
  apply/comment-sync/check jobs use the app token for comments, closes, and
  optional checks.
  Keep App credentials scoped to the `actions/create-github-app-token` step.
  Review shards run Codex over attacker-controlled issue/PR text, so
  `codexEnv()` also strips these App variables before spawning Codex.

Token flow:

- Review and repair jobs create an isolated per-run `CODEX_HOME`, start a local
  Responses proxy from `OPENAI_API_KEY`, write proxy-only Codex config there,
  and run Codex without OpenAI or Codex token environment variables.
- ClawSweeper uses the `clawsweeper` GitHub App token for read-heavy target
  context.
- Apply mode uses the same app token for review comments and closes, so GitHub
  attributes mutations to the app bot account instead of a PAT user.
- Commit review passes Codex only a read-scoped target token as `GH_TOKEN` for
  issue/PR/workflow/commit hydration, then creates write/check credentials only
  after Codex exits.
- The ClawSweeper GitHub App commits generated reports back to
  `valkyriweb/clawsweeper-state`.

Required `clawsweeper` app permissions:

- Contents: read/write, for report commits, repair branches, and repository
  dispatch inputs that need a contents-scoped installation token.
- Issues: read/write, for issue comments, labels, closes, and maintainer command
  authorization context.
- Pull requests: read/write, for PR comments, labels, merge readiness, repair PRs,
  and guarded automerge.
- Workflows: write, for adopted automerge repairs that need to rebase or update
  source branches containing `.github/workflows/*` changes.
- Actions: read/write on `openclaw/clawsweeper`, for run cancellation, manual
  dispatch, self-heal, and commit-review continuations.
- Checks: write on target repositories when commit Check Runs should be
  published.

ClawSweeper no longer falls back to PAT-based write tokens. If the GitHub App
installation does not grant the requested permission set, the workflow fails at
token creation instead of silently switching identity.

Target repository setup:

- install the issue/PR dispatcher from
  [docs/target-dispatcher.md](docs/target-dispatcher.md) for exact item event
  reviews
- install the commit dispatcher from
  [docs/commit-dispatcher.md](docs/commit-dispatcher.md) for `main` commit
  reviews
- set `CLAWSWEEPER_COMMIT_REVIEW_ENABLED=false` to disable commit dispatch
  without code changes
- set `CLAWSWEEPER_COMMIT_REVIEW_CREATE_CHECKS=true` only if commit Check Runs
  should be published
- optionally set `CLAWSWEEPER_COMMIT_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS=0` for manual
  backfills where the target commit range is already settled; the default is
  `60`
