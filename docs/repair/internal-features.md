# ClawSweeper Internal Feature Map

Read when: changing ClawSweeper automation, debugging a generated PR, wiring
comment commands, or deciding where a new lane belongs.

This document explains how the current ClawSweeper features fit together. It is
an internal maintainer map, not a runbook with secrets. Keep token values,
private key material, and one-off execution windows out of this file.

## Design Shape

ClawSweeper is a conservative, targeted automation layer for OpenClaw issue and
PR maintenance. It does not scan the whole backlog by itself. It takes a known
cluster, hydrates current GitHub state, asks Pi for a structured decision,
then lets deterministic scripts perform the allowed writes.

The core invariants:

- One cluster maps to one job file.
- One implementation path maps to one branch: `clawsweeper/<cluster-id>`.
- One branch should produce or update one PR.
- Model workers do not get GitHub write tokens.
- GitHub writes happen through deterministic scripts with live-state checks.
- Merge stays closed unless a maintainer explicitly opens the merge gate.
- Security-sensitive work is out of scope and must be routed elsewhere.

## Main Objects

### Job File

Path: `jobs/<repo-slug>/inbox/*.md`

A job file is the durable request. It contains frontmatter for the repo,
cluster id, refs, mode, allowed actions, gates, and the maintainer prompt. It
is committed before dispatch because Actions reads the job file from GitHub.

Common creation paths:

- `pnpm run repair:create-job -- --repo openclaw/openclaw --refs 123 --prompt-file /tmp/prompt.md`
- `pnpm run repair:create-job -- --from-report ../clawsweeper/records/.../items/123.md`
- gitcrawl import scripts for larger clustered backlog batches

`create-job` checks for an existing matching PR or branch before writing a new
job. That is the primary duplicate-PR guard.

### Cluster Plan

Path: `.clawsweeper-repair/runs/<run>/cluster-plan.json`

Created by `scripts/plan-cluster.ts`. It hydrates the listed GitHub refs,
linked refs, labels, bodies, comments, PR files, PR reviews, PR review
comments, checks, and current `main` state. The Pi worker receives this as
its live evidence bundle.

### Worker Result

Path: `.clawsweeper-repair/runs/<run>/result.json`

Created by `scripts/run-worker.ts` via the Pi CLI using
`schema/repair/codex-result.schema.json`. The worker can recommend actions and fix
artifacts, but it must not mutate GitHub directly.

`scripts/review-results.ts` validates the result before any follow-up lane
trusts it.

Long model calls emit periodic `[clawsweeper repair] ... still running` log
lines from the wrapper process. This covers the Pi planning worker plus
execute-side Codex edit, review, rebase-reconcile, and write-preflight subprocesses,
so GitHub Actions does not kill otherwise healthy repair jobs for lack of output
before debug artifact collection steps can run.

### Codex Debug Artifacts

Artifact names:

- `clawsweeper-codex-debug-cluster-<run-id>-<attempt>`
- `clawsweeper-codex-debug-execute-<run-id>-<attempt>`

The repair workflow snapshots recent Codex session JSONL files, Codex log files,
and ClawSweeper-captured `codex exec --json` outputs after both the planning job
and the fix execution job. Session/log files come from the job's isolated
`CODEX_HOME` when set, otherwise `~/.codex`; captured repair outputs come from
`.clawsweeper-repair/runs`.
The collector deliberately excludes Codex auth and config files, redacts common
OpenAI and GitHub token shapes, and writes a `manifest.json` with
source-relative paths, byte counts, mtimes, and SHA-256 hashes. These debug
artifacts are separate from the worker-transfer artifact, so the execute job
does not download raw session logs just to continue a repair.

### Fix Artifact

Path: `.clawsweeper-repair/runs/<run>/fix-artifact.json` and embedded result
fields.

A fix artifact tells the deterministic executor how to repair a contributor
branch or create/update a ClawSweeper replacement branch. It includes likely
files, validation commands, credit notes, changelog requirements, source PRs,
and the planned PR title/body.

### Published Ledger

Paths:

- `results/runs/*.json`
- `results/openclaw/*.md`
- `repair-apply-report.json`
- `docs/repair/README.md` dashboard sections

These are the sanitized durable record. Full prompts, transcripts, and raw run
artifacts stay in Actions artifacts or local `.clawsweeper-repair/runs`.

## Modes

### `plan`

Read-only recommendation mode. The worker classifies the cluster and returns
structured JSON. No GitHub writes should happen.

### `execute`

Structured-result application mode. It can apply reviewed safe comments,
closures, and explicit merge actions, but only through deterministic scripts
and only when gates permit.

### `autonomous`

Full targeted repair mode. ClawSweeper hydrates live state, asks Codex to produce
or refine a fix plan, then `execute-fix-artifact` can repair a branch or open a
replacement PR. Direct mutation still happens outside Codex.

## Cloud Worker Flow

Workflow: `.github/workflows/repair-cluster-worker.yml`

The cluster worker has two jobs:

1. `cluster`
   - checks out ClawSweeper
   - mints a read GitHub App token when configured
   - installs Codex
   - validates the job
   - hydrates the cluster
   - runs Codex in read-only mode
   - reviews the structured result
   - uploads transfer artifacts

2. `execute`
   - runs only for `execute` or `autonomous`
   - mints a write GitHub App token, including workflow-file write permission,
     when configured
   - downloads worker artifacts
   - runs `execute-fix-artifact`
   - runs `apply-result`
   - runs `post-flight`
   - labels ClawSweeper targets
   - uploads final artifacts

The workflow concurrency group is based on job path and mode, so repeat
dispatches of the same job queue instead of racing each other.

## Creating Implementation PRs

Script: `scripts/execute-fix-artifact.ts`

This is the PR creation and branch repair engine.

It can:

- update a maintainer-editable contributor branch when that path is safe
- fall back to a replacement branch when the source branch is uneditable or
  unsafe
- fast-path adopted automerge base-sync repairs by rebasing, applying known
  mechanical conflict resolvers, pushing, and letting the fresh exact-head
  review/check gates handle merge readiness
- create or update `clawsweeper/<cluster-id>`
- push checkpoint commits after Codex edits
- run changed-surface validation
- run Codex `/review`
- address Codex review findings
- open or update the target PR
- post an idempotent adopted-automerge outcome comment when no executable fix
  artifact is available
- preserve contributor credit in co-author trailers, PR body, and closeout comments

The executor prepares a temporary checkout of the target repo. Codex edits that
checkout without GitHub credentials. The deterministic executor commits,
pushes, opens PRs, and comments using the GitHub token.

For same-branch automerge repairs, the executor can stay alive after pushing a
deterministic repair. It waits for the exact-head ClawSweeper verdict and GitHub
checks on the new head, then dispatches the comment router immediately when the
PR is ready so merge does not depend on the next scheduled sweep. See
[`automerge-flow.md`](automerge-flow.md) for the full wait and repair decision
table.

When replacing a meaningful contributor PR, the executor fetches the source PR
author, skips bot authors, adds `Co-authored-by` trailers to replacement
checkpoint commits, records carried-forward credit in the replacement PR body,
and says in the source close comment that the contribution is carried forward
rather than rejected.

Generated ClawSweeper PRs are marked by:

- branch prefix: `clawsweeper/`
- committed repair job metadata for the branch cluster id

The `clawsweeper` label is a reporting hint from `scripts/tag-clawsweeper-targets.ts`,
not a PR identity boundary.

Current operational gotcha: OpenClaw's PR queue policy can close PRs when the
ClawSweeper app author has more than 10 active PRs. That is a target-repo policy
interaction, not evidence that the generated PR is invalid. Reduce or land the
active ClawSweeper queue before reopening those PRs.

Replacement PR creation also has a per-area backpressure guard. Before opening a
new `clawsweeper/*` replacement branch, `execute-fix-artifact` groups the proposed
`likely_files` into touched areas such as `extensions/discord`, `src/core`, or
`docs`, reads open ClawSweeper PRs in the target repo, and blocks if the same area
already has `CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_ACTIVE_PRS_PER_AREA` open ClawSweeper PRs. The default
limit is `50`; set it to `0` only for a deliberately uncapped execution window.
Common changelog and release-note files are ignored for this backpressure check
because they are shared support files rather than a meaningful repair area.

## ClawSweeper Commit Findings

Workflow: `.github/workflows/repair-commit-finding-intake.yml`
Script: `scripts/commit-finding-intake.ts`

ClawSweeper can dispatch `clawsweeper_commit_finding` when a main-branch commit
review report has `result: findings`. ClawSweeper treats that report as a source
finding, not as an order to open a PR.

The intake step fetches the report from latest `openclaw/clawsweeper@main`,
writes one audit file, and then decides whether an automatic repair PR is
allowed:

- audit path: `results/commit-findings/<repo-slug>/<sha>.md`
- job path: `jobs/<owner>/inbox/clawsweeper-commit-<repo-slug>-<shortsha>.md`
- branch: `clawsweeper/clawsweeper-commit-<repo-slug>-<shortsha>`

Non-finding, disabled, security/privacy/supply-chain, and broad findings stop
at the audit record. Eligible ordinary bug/regression/reliability findings get a
deterministic synthetic ClawSweeper result and fix artifact. That skips the normal
cluster-planning Codex pass and sends the report straight to
`execute-fix-artifact`, where Codex is used for the repair loop against latest
target `main`. The executor handles trivial branch-refresh work before asking
Codex to edit: a clean rebase that changes only commit ancestry skips the edit
pass, and an isolated `CHANGELOG.md` rebase conflict is merged mechanically by
preserving both sides before validation continues. Generated config checksum
conflicts are also merged mechanically by keeping replayed checksum entries and
current-main entries that the replayed commit did not touch.

Commit-finding fix artifacts set `allow_no_pr: true`. If the repair loop
verifies the report but produces no target-repo diff, ClawSweeper records a clean
skipped no-PR outcome instead of failing the workflow.

The generated job uses `source: clawsweeper_commit` and may have no issue/PR
`candidates`. The fix artifact uses `repair_strategy: new_fix_pr`; merge and
close actions remain blocked.

## Issue Implementation Commands

Maintainer comments can turn an open issue into one ClawSweeper implementation
PR with `/clawsweeper implement`, `@clawsweeper fix`, `/clawsweeper build`,
`@clawsweeper create pr`, or `@clawsweeper fix issue`.

The comment router creates or reuses
`jobs/<owner>/inbox/issue-<owner>-<repo>-<number>.md` with
`source: issue_implementation` and target branch
`clawsweeper/issue-<owner>-<repo>-<number>`. The job allows comment, label,
fix, and raise-pr actions, blocks close and merge, and tells the repair worker
to verify the issue against latest `main` before emitting
`repair_strategy: new_fix_pr`.

This lane is intentionally PR-only: it does not merge, close the source issue,
or convert broad/security-sensitive requests into public branches. Reruns reuse
the same job and branch, so repeated maintainer comments update one PR instead
of creating duplicates.

### Reviewed Reproducible Bug Intake

`repair-issue-implementation-intake.yml` is the automatic version of the issue
implementation lane. It is enabled only when
`CLAWSWEEPER_AUTO_IMPLEMENT_REPRO_BUGS=1`.

The review report must be a strict bug candidate:

- `type: issue`
- `decision: keep_open`
- `confidence: high`
- `work_candidate: queue_fix_pr`
- `work_confidence: high`
- `item_category: bug`
- `reproduction_status: reproduced`
- `reproduction_confidence: high`
- `requires_new_feature: false`
- `requires_new_config_option: false`
- `requires_product_decision: false`

The intake re-fetches the live issue before writing a job. It skips protected,
security-sensitive, locked, closed, stale, or already-PR-attached issues, and it
also skips when the deterministic `clawsweeper/issue-<owner>-<repo>-<number>`
branch already has an open PR.

Eligible jobs reuse `source: issue_implementation`,
`trigger_source: review_reproducible_bug`, and the deterministic issue
implementation branch. The worker prompt is bug-only: reproduce first, fix
broken existing behavior only, and stop if implementation requires a feature,
config option, product decision, or broad design change. Any PR created from the
job is labeled `clawsweeper:autogenerated` in addition to the normal
`clawsweeper` tracking label.

## Applying Comments, Closures, And Merges

Script: `scripts/apply-result.ts`

This script owns safe GitHub mutations from reviewed worker results.

It re-fetches every live target before writing. It blocks when:

- the target changed since review
- the target is closed
- the target is maintainer-authored and not explicitly allowed
- the target is security-sensitive
- the job does not allow the action
- the action lacks required canonical/fix evidence
- merge preflight is incomplete

Close comments include idempotency markers so reruns do not post duplicates.

Merging is intentionally hard. Merge requires:

- job allows merge
- `allow_merge: true`
- `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_MERGE=1`
- clean merge state
- clean relevant checks
- resolved human review threads
- resolved review-bot findings
- passed Codex `/review`
- validation evidence
- security clearance

With merge gated closed, ClawSweeper labels ready candidates for human review
instead of merging.

## Post-Flight Finalization

Script: `scripts/post-flight.ts`

Post-flight watches the PRs that `execute-fix-artifact` opened or repaired.
It waits for merge readiness, validates merge preflight, and either:

- merges when the merge gate is explicitly open, or
- labels the PR with human-review/merge-ready labels, or
- records the exact blocker.

After a canonical fix lands, post-flight can apply planned post-merge closeouts
for duplicate or superseded items covered by that fix.

## Open PR Finalizer

Workflow: `.github/workflows/finalize-open-prs.yml`
Script: `scripts/finalize-open-prs.ts`

The finalizer scans open ClawSweeper PRs in the target repo. It finds PRs by the
`clawsweeper/*` branch prefix. It classifies blockers:

- draft
- stale/conflicting branch
- dirty or unknown merge state
- failing or pending checks
- unresolved review threads
- review required or changes requested
- missing merge preflight
- missing result backfill
- security hold

When `--dispatch-repairs --execute` is enabled, it dispatches the existing
cluster job back through `repair-cluster-worker.yml` instead of creating another PR.
The idempotency key includes target repo, PR number, and head SHA, so the same
PR/head is not repeatedly repaired unless `--allow-repeat` is used.

This is the lane to extend for richer CI self-repair. The next improvement is
to fetch compact failed-check logs, classify transient infra failures, rerun
clearly transient jobs, and pass branch-caused failures into the repair prompt.

## Self-Heal Failed ClawSweeper Runs

Workflow: `.github/workflows/repair-self-heal.yml`
Script: `src/repair/self-heal-failed-runs.ts`

Self-heal retries failed ClawSweeper cluster-worker runs. It reads published
`results/runs/*.json`, selects the latest failed run per source job, skips jobs
already retried unless `--allow-repeat` is set, and dispatches fresh worker
runs.

Important distinction: this heals failed ClawSweeper worker runs. It does not
currently inspect target PR CI logs. Target PR repair belongs in the open PR
finalizer/comment command repair path.

## Maintainer Comment Routing

Workflow: `.github/workflows/repair-comment-router.yml`
Scripts:

- `src/repair/comment-router.ts`
- `src/repair/comment-router-core.ts`

Comment routing scans recent target-repo issue/PR comments and accepts only
maintainer-authored commands. Default allowed GitHub `author_association`
values:

- `OWNER`
- `MEMBER`
- `COLLABORATOR`

Contributor comments are ignored without a reply.

The generated-PR auto-update design is documented in
[`docs/repair/auto-update-prs.md`](auto-update-prs.md). That lane lets trusted
ClawSweeper comments dispatch a repair run for an existing ClawSweeper PR or a
PR explicitly opted into `clawsweeper:automerge` without allowing arbitrary
comment authors to trigger work.

Accepted command styles:

```text
/clawsweeper status
@clawsweeper status
@openclaw-clawsweeper status
@openclaw-clawsweeper[bot] status
```

Accepted mentions are `@clawsweeper`, `@clawsweeper[bot]`,
`@openclaw-clawsweeper`, and `@openclaw-clawsweeper[bot]`.

Supported commands:

```text
/review
/clawsweeper status
/clawsweeper re-review
/clawsweeper re-run
/clawsweeper fix ci
/clawsweeper address review
/clawsweeper rebase
/clawsweeper autofix
/clawsweeper automerge
/clawsweeper approve
/clawsweeper explain
/clawsweeper stop
@clawsweeper re-review
@clawsweeper re-run
@clawsweeper review
@openclaw-clawsweeper fix ci
@clawsweeper why did automerge stop here?
```

Behavior:

- `status` and `explain`: post a short status response.
- `review`, `re-review`, and `re-run`: dispatch ClawSweeper review again for an
  open issue or PR. Authors may use only these read-only review commands on
  their own open item; maintainer permission remains required for write actions.
- Freeform `@clawsweeper ...` maintainer mentions: dispatch a read-only assist
  review with the mention text as one-off instructions. The model can answer or
  recommend existing structured safe actions, but cannot directly merge, close,
  label, or push code.
- `fix ci`: dispatch the existing ClawSweeper PR's job for repair.
- `address review`: dispatch the existing ClawSweeper PR's job for repair.
- `rebase`: dispatch the existing ClawSweeper PR's job for repair.
- `autofix`: label any open PR with `clawsweeper:autofix`, create an adopted
  job if needed, and dispatch a ClawSweeper review for the current head without
  allowing merge.
- `automerge`: label any open PR with `clawsweeper:automerge`, create an
  adopted job if needed, and dispatch a ClawSweeper review for the current
  head.
- `approve`: maintainer-only exact-head approval after human review; clears
  pause labels and merges only through the normal automerge readiness checks and
  merge gates.
- `stop`: label the item for human review.

Repair commands apply to existing ClawSweeper PRs and PRs opted into
`clawsweeper:autofix` or `clawsweeper:automerge`. The router finds ClawSweeper PRs by the
`clawsweeper/*` branch, resolves or creates the backing job, posts one
idempotent response marker, and dispatches `repair-cluster-worker.yml`.

Trusted ClawSweeper comments become `clawsweeper_auto_repair`. Preferred
comments use hidden `clawsweeper-verdict:*` markers and include
`clawsweeper-action:fix-required` only when ClawSweeper should wake up. For PRs
already opted into `clawsweeper:autofix` or `clawsweeper:automerge`, trusted
`needs-human` and `human-review` verdicts pause the loop with
`clawsweeper:human-review`. Repair dispatch requires an accepted repair verdict
or action marker. The default caps are ten automatic repair iterations per PR
and one dispatch per PR head SHA. The per-PR cap is total across head SHA
changes, so repeated findings on the same commit do not stampede the branch and
a single PR cannot loop forever.

For PRs labeled `clawsweeper:autofix` or `clawsweeper:automerge`, trusted
ClawSweeper `pass`, `approved`, or `no-changes` verdict markers become
`clawsweeper_auto_merge`. Autofix and draft PRs never merge. Automerge merges
only when the marker SHA matches the current PR head, checks are green, GitHub
mergeability is clean, no human-review label is present, the PR is not draft,
and `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_MERGE=1` is set. The `clawsweeper:automerge` opt-in is
the per-PR automerge authorization.
Otherwise it leaves the PR open and labels it `clawsweeper:human-review` and
`clawsweeper:merge-ready` when merge gates are closed.

The scheduled workflow is dry by default. Set
`CLAWSWEEPER_COMMENT_ROUTER_EXECUTE=1` to let scheduled runs post replies and
dispatch workers. Manual workflow dispatch can also pass `execute=true`.
Branch mutation still requires the downstream `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_EXECUTE=1` and
`CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_FIX_PR=1` gates.

Ledgers:

- `results/comment-router.json`: processed command ledger
- `results/comment-router-latest.json`: latest scan report

Command replies are marker-backed and edited in place per item, intent, and
head SHA. Repeated maintainer nudges update the same small status comment
instead of leaving duplicate crustacean notes.

## Label Backfill

Script: `scripts/tag-clawsweeper-targets.ts`

This script labels ClawSweeper-created or ClawSweeper-tracked PRs/issues in the
target repo. It helps downstream tools and maintainers distinguish generated
work from ordinary contributor work.

The exact label is `clawsweeper`. The script intentionally refuses alternate
label names to keep the marker stable. Live GitHub reads and label mutations use
the retrying `gh` helpers so transient GitHub 502/503/504 responses do not fail
an otherwise completed worker run. The worker workflow also treats this tagging
step as non-blocking metadata; durable repair/apply results remain the source of
truth.

## Job Hygiene

Scripts:

- `scripts/sweep-openclaw-jobs.ts`
- `scripts/promote-stuck-jobs.ts`
- `scripts/requeue-job.ts`

These scripts manage the ClawSweeper backlog:

- move finalized jobs out of inbox
- park old or never-run jobs in outbox/stuck
- promote parked jobs back into inbox
- resolve a run id or job path and requeue it

They should not create new implementation PRs by themselves. They control job
inventory and dispatch pressure.

## Dashboard Publishing

Workflow: `.github/workflows/publish-results.yml`
Script: `scripts/publish-result.ts`

Publishing turns raw run artifacts into durable, sanitized summaries. It updates
the README dashboard, per-cluster markdown reports, and aggregate JSON ledgers.

The README dashboard is the public status surface, but it is derived from the
latest published artifacts. For live truth, check GitHub Actions and the target
PR directly.

## Gates And Variables

Important gates:

- `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_EXECUTE`: allows deterministic write lanes. Workflows treat
  any value except literal `1` as closed.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_FIX_PR`: allows branch repair and replacement PR creation.
  Workflows treat any value except literal `1` as closed.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_ALLOW_MERGE`: allows ClawSweeper to merge. Keep this `0` unless a
  maintainer explicitly opens it.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_COMMENT_ROUTER_EXECUTE`: lets scheduled comment routing post
  replies and dispatch workers.

Important defaults:

- `CLAWSWEEPER_MODEL`: default worker model, usually `gpt-5.5`.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT`: model reasoning effort. Repair workers
  default to `high` and normalize accidental `xhigh` overrides back to `high`
  to keep automerge repair latency predictable.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_CODEX_SERVICE_TIER`: Codex service tier. Repair workers default
  to `fast`.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_CODEX_HEARTBEAT_MS`: repair-worker and execute-side Codex
  subprocess heartbeat interval; default `60000`.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_LIVE_WORKERS`: dispatch capacity guard.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_DISPATCH_RECHECK_MS`: short active-worker recheck before
  dispatching a repair worker; default `5000` to avoid duplicate queued workers
  when parallel routers race GitHub run visibility.
- In-flight branch repair execution re-fetches live PR labels immediately before
  branch mutation and refuses to push when `clawsweeper:human-review` is present.
  This makes trusted needs-human verdicts and maintainer stop commands win over
  stale already-queued repair workers.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_MAX_ACTIVE_PRS_PER_AREA`: replacement PR area backpressure; default
  is `50` open ClawSweeper PRs per touched area, and `0` disables the cap.
- ClawSweeper commit-finding repair PRs get the `clawsweeper:commit-finding`
  label in addition to the standard `clawsweeper` tracking label.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_TARGET_VALIDATION_MODE`: changed-only validation by default.
- `CLAWSWEEPER_RESOLVE_REVIEW_THREADS`: lets fix execution resolve threads after
  it addresses them.

## Where To Add New Behavior

- New issue/PR-to-PR entrypoint: extend `create-job` or add an importer that
  writes the same job schema.
- Better CI self-repair: extend `finalize-open-prs` to collect failed check
  logs and classify rerun vs repair.
- New maintainer command: extend `comment-router-core.ts` parsing and
  `comment-router.ts` execution.
- New mutation type: add schema support, worker prompt policy, result review
  validation, and deterministic application in `apply-result`.
- New dashboard field: publish it from `publish-result`, not from ad hoc README
  edits.

## Safety Checklist For Changes

Before shipping automation changes:

```bash
pnpm run repair:validate
pnpm run check
actionlint .github/workflows/<changed-workflow>.yml
git diff --check
```

For live lanes, dry-run first when available:

```bash
pnpm run repair:comment-router -- --repo openclaw/openclaw --lookback-minutes 180
pnpm run repair:finalize-open-prs -- --write-report
pnpm run repair:tag-clawsweeper -- --live
```

Do not treat a dry report as permission to mutate. A maintainer still needs to
open the relevant execution gate or run the workflow with `execute=true`.
