# Execute Mode

Execute mode still returns structured JSON first. Do not mutate GitHub directly.

The runner applies safe closure actions after your JSON passes validation. Your job is to classify the cluster and emit auditable actions that the deterministic GitHub applicator can replay.

Security-sensitive items are out of scope. If a title, body, label, review, comment, or file context suggests vulnerability, advisory, CVE/GHSA, leaked secret, credential, token, API key, plaintext secret storage, exploitability, security-class injection, SSRF/XSS/CSRF/RCE, or sensitive data exposure, emit `route_security` for that exact item and do not mutate it. Continue classifying unrelated non-security items.

For each target action, include:

- `target`: issue/PR ref like `#123`; for a cluster-level `build_fix_artifact`, use `cluster:<cluster_id>`
- emit one action per target. Never use comma-separated refs, ranges, or grouped target lists in `target`.
- `action`: one of `keep_canonical`, `keep_related`, `keep_independent`, `keep_closed`, `merge_candidate`, `merge_canonical`, `fix_needed`, `build_fix_artifact`, `open_fix_pr`, `route_security`, `needs_human`, `close_duplicate`, `close_superseded`, `close_fixed_by_candidate`, or `close_low_signal`
- `classification`: one of `canonical`, `duplicate`, `related`, `superseded`, `independent`, `fixed_by_candidate`, `low_signal`, `security_sensitive`, or `needs_human`
- `target_kind`: `issue` or `pull_request`
- `target_updated_at`: the live GitHub `updatedAt`/`updated_at` value you fetched for the target
- `canonical`, `duplicate_of`, or `candidate_fix` when the close depends on another issue/PR; use an issue/PR ref like `#123`, never a date, year, bare unrelated number, or prose-only link
- Use `canonical`, `duplicate_of`, and `candidate_fix` only for refs present in the hydrated preflight item matrix. If a candidate PR is only mentioned in comments or prior automation notes, keep it in evidence/fix artifact context and leave `candidate_fix` null.
- `comment`: the exact close comment you recommend, preserving contributor credit and linking the canonical or candidate fix
- `idempotency_key`: stable key such as `clawsweeper-repair:<cluster_id>:<target>:<action>:<canonical-or-fix>`
- `evidence`: short concrete evidence strings

The applicator only auto-closes:

- true duplicates with a clear `canonical`/`duplicate_of`;
- superseded items with a clear surviving canonical candidate;
- items clearly covered by a candidate fix with `candidate_fix`.
- low-signal PRs only when the job explicitly sets `triage_policy: low_signal_prs` and `allow_low_signal_pr_close: true`.

Everything else should be `planned` as non-mutating or escalated as `needs_human`. Do not use `executed`; Projectclawsweeper records execution only after the applicator safely replays a planned mutation.
Set `fix_artifact.allow_no_pr` to `false` for normal fix/replacement PRs, and use `true` only for an explicitly audited no-PR outcome.

For any `fix_artifact` you emit: `pr_title` must follow Conventional Commits (e.g. `fix: …`, `feat: …`, `refactor: …`), use imperative mood, be 72 characters or fewer, and have no trailing period. `pr_body` must contain these sections in order: `## Summary` (what + why, 2–4 sentences), `## Changes` (bulleted file/behavior changes), `## Verification` (what was run/tested), `## Source` (link to originating finding/record and workflow run URL when available; omit the run URL line rather than fabricating it).
Already-closed refs are non-mutating evidence only. Use `keep_closed` with `status: "skipped"` if they must appear in the action matrix.

Merge actions require `merge_preflight` for the target. Before recommending a merge, prove security-sensitive issues are cleared, all actionable comments and review threads are resolved, Greptile/Codex/Asile/CodeRabbit/Copilot and similar bot findings are addressed or proven non-actionable, Codex `/review` has passed, every review finding is addressed, and changed-surface validation is clean. For OpenClaw, `pnpm check:changed` plus diff checks is sufficient local validation unless the job explicitly asks for strict validation. Missing proof means `needs_human` or a blocked/non-mutating action, not merge.

Never force-push, rewrite contributor branches, bypass failing checks, merge, label, comment, or close directly from the worker. Return structured JSON only.
